Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
